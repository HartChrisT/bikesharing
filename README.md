### Summary

When looking at ridership by birth year during the month of August, ridership steadily increases until 1990 and then declines. However during the year of 1969 is an anomaly. I would like to further investigate as to why that is the case. I would also like to take all data from the data set with birthdates of riders that precede 1930. After the data is cleaned thoroughly, I would like to rerun the data to see if the trends among genders, subscribers, and ride times still persist, and to what extent.
